### 🧠 About

Self-learning my way through the cybersecurity world — one lab, one exploit, one script at a time.  
Currently building real skills in:

- 🧩 DSA in Python  
- 🛡️ Blue Team: SOC Tools, Threat Detection, SIEM  
- ⚔️ Red Team: Web Hacking, Kali Linux, Burp Suite  
- 🐧 Linux • Bash • Scripting  
- 📖 TryHackMe, Real-world labs, and more

I'm here to document it all, stay consistent, and show proof of work.

### 🌍 My Journey = Learning in Public

No shortcuts.  
No fake flex.  
Just daily progress, curiosity, and proof of work.

> “One step a day toward becoming a badass cyber engineer.”
